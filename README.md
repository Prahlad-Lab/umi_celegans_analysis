# UMI C. elegans Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains scripts and tools for analyzing UMI (Unique Molecular Identifier) data from *C. elegans* samples.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prahlad-Lab/umi_celegans_analysis.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Repository Directory

Change directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd umi_celegans_analysis
```

### Step 3: Extract Input Files

The repository includes compressed input files that need to be extracted before running the analysis:

```bash
cd input
tar -xzvf inputs.tar.gz
cd ..
```

This will extract the reference genome files and other required input data.

### Step 4: Set Up Conda Environments

Return to the main repository folder and set up the required conda environments. You have two options:

**Option 1: Combined Environment (Recommended for Simple Setup)**

```bash
./setup_conda_environments.sh all
```

This creates a single environment called `umi_celegans_analysis` with all tools. Activate it with:

```bash
conda activate umi_celegans_analysis
```

**Option 2: Separate Environments (Matches Pipeline Structure)**

```bash
./setup_conda_environments.sh separate
```

This creates individual environments for each tool (fastqc, bcftools, umi_tools, gatk4, fgbio, snpeff, samtools.v1.22, STAR).

### Step 5: Run the Analysis Pipeline

The main analysis pipeline is `UMI_analysis_pipeline_5.sh`. This script performs the complete UMI-based variant calling analysis.

**What the pipeline does:**
- Quality control (FastQC)
- Converts FastQ to unmapped BAM
- Extracts UMIs from reads
- Aligns reads using STAR
- Groups reads by UMI
- Filters BAMs by family size
- Performs variant calling with GATK HaplotypeCaller
- Annotates variants with SnpEff
- Calculates allele proportions

**Output folders created:**
The pipeline creates an `output_subset` directory with the following subdirectories:
- `fastqc/` - Quality control reports
- `FastqToUbam/` - Unmapped BAM files
- `ExtractUmisFromBam/` - UMI-extracted BAM files
- `STARNoClip/` - STAR alignment outputs
- `UMIAwareDuplicateMarkingGenomeNoClip/` - UMI-grouped BAM files
- `FilterBambyFamilySizeGenome/` - Family-size filtered BAM files
- `Family_size1_haplotype_caller/` - GATK variant calling outputs
- `Family_size1_annotation/` - SnpEff annotated variants
- `Family_size1_bcftools_mpileup/` - bcftools pileup results
- `Family_size1_allele_proportions_depth/` - Allele proportion calculations

**To run the pipeline:**

```bash
# Activate the conda environment
conda activate umi_celegans_analysis

# Run the pipeline
./UMI_analysis_pipeline_5.sh
```

**Note:** This pipeline is designed to run on an HPC cluster with SLURM. If running locally, you may need to remove or modify the SLURM directives at the top of the script.

**Testing Information:** The main pipeline was tested with UB CCR (University at Buffalo Center for Computational Research), using 32 cores and 100GB of memory, with a runtime of 9:44 minutes.

### Step 6: Set Up R Environment for Variant Analysis

To perform downstream variant analysis using R scripts, you need to set up an R environment with the required packages:

```bash
./setup_conda_r_variant_analysis.sh
```

This creates a conda environment called `r_variant_analysis` with all necessary R packages including:
- tidyverse, scales, ggpubr, cowplot for data manipulation and visualization
- vcfR for VCF file handling
- rstatix for statistical analysis
- Bioconductor packages (rtracklayer, plyranges)

Activate the R environment:

```bash
conda activate r_variant_analysis
```

### Step 7: Run R Analysis Scripts

The `R_Scripts/` directory contains scripts for downstream analysis:

**1. Allelic Proportion Analysis** (`R_Scripts/allelic_proportion_analysis_depth.r`)

This script analyzes allele proportions from variant calling results and creates visualization plots.

```bash
# Activate the R environment
conda activate r_variant_analysis

# Run the R script
Rscript R_Scripts/allelic_proportion_analysis_depth.r
```

Or run interactively in R/RStudio:
```r
source("R_Scripts/allelic_proportion_analysis_depth.r")
```

**Input:** Uses data from `Family_size1_allele_proportions_depth/` directory
**Output:** Histogram/density plots and violin plots showing allele proportion distributions

**2. Variant Genome Analysis** (`R_Scripts/Haplotypecaller.Variants.Genome.Analysis_singletons.R`)

This script performs comprehensive analysis of variants called by GATK HaplotypeCaller.

```bash
# Activate the R environment
conda activate r_variant_analysis

# Run the R script in R/RStudio
R
> source("R_Scripts/Haplotypecaller.Variants.Genome.Analysis_singletons.R")
```

**Input:** Uses annotated VCF files from `Family_size1_annotation/` directory
**Output:** Variant analysis results, statistical comparisons, and visualizations

**Note:** You may need to update file paths in the R scripts to match your output directory structure.

## Prerequisites

Before running the analysis pipeline, you need to install the required bioinformatics tools using conda.
